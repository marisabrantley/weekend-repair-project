# Weekend Repair Project
This exercise used factory functions to create vehicle objects, and an event to display which vehicles need repairing when a button is clicked.

## Objective
* Create a factory function to create vehicles that accepts type, numWheels, and color parameters.
* Create three new objects and add them to an array, looping over the array and then the properties and values of each object.
* Add properties to vehicles that will need mechanical attention.
* Create a click event so when a button is clicked, the new array will display the vehicles that need repairs.
